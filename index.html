	<h1>Welcome,</h1>

	<p>There’s not much to see here yet as the site is being constructed slowly in my spare time.</p>

	<p>This site is intended to be a repository of my designs used in building synthesisers and audio equipment for my own use.</p>

	<p>Projects are put here for information purposes, to be referred to in designing and building your own circuits. No support will be given to anyone attempting to build their own versions and I accept no responsibility for anything that happens as a result of people building their own circuits based on this information. It is assumed you have sufficient knowledge of electronics to understand the workings of the circuits and the skill to construct them unaided.</p>

	<p>While I have some background and experience in electronics I don’t claim to be an expert - I designed these circuits solely for my own use.</p>

	<p>If PCB designs are included, they are for personal use only, in small runs and should not be used for commercial gain. PCB designs remain my Intellectual Property.</p>
